  "description": "## Introduction\n\nArtificial Intelligence is reshaping creative expression, with **prompt engineering** emerging as a crucial skill that connects human intent with AI-generated outcomes. Designing effective prompts is now an essential competency for students engaging with modern AI tools.\n\nThe **Computer Engineering Innovation and Tech Club (CITC), NCIT** presents **\"Prompt to Image\"**, an AI-based creativity competition that challenges participants to transform structured textual prompts into compelling visual outputs. The event emphasizes creativity, storytelling, and ethical AI usage over technical complexity.\n\n---\n\n## Event Overview\n\nParticipants are provided with a standardized **prompt framework** containing predefined blank spaces. By creatively completing the framework, participants generate a meaningful paragraph that serves as the final prompt for AI-based image generation.\n\nThis format ensures:\n- Equal creative opportunity for all participants  \n- Strong focus on prompt engineering and storytelling  \n- Emphasis on originality and human intent\n\nEach participant submits:\n- A completed prompt paragraph  \n- One AI-generated image  \n- A brief concept explanation\n\n---\n\n## Eligibility\n\n- Open to all students of **Nepal College of Information Technology (NCIT)**  \n- **Individual participation only**\n\n---\n\n## Competition Structure\n\nThe competition is conducted in **two phases**:\n\n**Phase-I (Online Round):**\nParticipants submit their completed prompt and AI-generated image online. Entries are evaluated by judges along with public engagement. The **Top 10 participants** qualify for the final round.\n\n**Phase-II (Physical Final Round):**\nFinalists compete physically at **NCIT**, where a new prompt framework is provided on the spot. Participants generate AI images live, followed by judge-based evaluation.\n\n---\n\n## Evaluation Overview\n\nEvaluation focuses on creativity, prompt quality, visual coherence, concept clarity, and ethical AI use. Phase-I includes both judges’ evaluation and public engagement, while Phase-II is primarily judge-based.\n\n*Detailed rules and evaluation criteria are available in the official Rule Book.*\n\n---\n\n## Important Dates\n\n- **Phase-I Submission Period:** 18th January – 25th January, 00:00 NPT  \n- **Phase-II Schedule:** To be announced via CITC platforms\n\n---\n\n## Prizes & Recognition\n\n- 🏆 **Winner:** NPR 3,000 + Certificate & Medal  \n- 🥈 **Runner-Up:** NPR 2,000 + Certificate & Medal  \n- 🥉 **Second Runner-Up:** NPR 1,000 + Certificate & Medal  \n\nDigital certificates will be provided to all participants.\n\n---\n\n## Rule Book\n\nAll participants must read and follow the **Participants Rule Book**, which contains detailed guidelines, submission rules, ethical policies, and evaluation criteria.\n\n---\n\n## Contact & Support\n\nFor queries or clarifications:\n📧 **citc@ncit.edu.np**  \nor reach out through **CITC official social media platforms**",
